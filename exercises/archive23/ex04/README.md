# NLPwDL 2023/24 Exercise 04

## Tasks

### Task 1

Implement a list of ScalarNodes that we will call a LinearLayer that takes the previous layer's nodes and create a pre-defined number of linear nodes in this layer (so-called "fully connected layer"). The parameters (weights and biases) should all be set to 0.01.

### Task 2

Implement online gradient descent training of a log-linear model. We have synthetic, linearly separable data for a binary classification task (labeled as 0 and 1), see the Jupyter notebook in bin/notebooks/ex4_dataset_visualisations.ipynb

### Solutions

Solutions will be included as part of the next exercise

## Setup

Create a virtual environment

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Run unittests from the command line

```bash
$ python -m unittest
```
